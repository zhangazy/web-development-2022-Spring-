        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Whisk all the ingredients, except the flour, together. Add in the flour, a little bit at a time, whisking just until the flour has been mixed in. 
            <br> <strong>Step 2: </strong>Let the crepe batter rest for 10 minutes. Then, give the batter a quick whisk again before using 
            <br><strong>Step 3:</strong>Grease a non-stick, 6" skillet with unsalted butter and heat over medium heat. Pour about 2-3 tablespoons worth of batter into the pan and tip the pan from side to side to get the batter to spread out throughout the pan. 
            <br> <strong>Step 4:</strong>Cook each side of the crepe for 30 seconds before gently loosening up the edges with a large spatula. If it lifts, then the crepe is ready to be flipped. If it doesn't lift up very well, give it 10 to 15 more seconds and try again. Gently lift the crepe out of the pan, then flip over into the pan and cook the other side for another 10 to 15 seconds; remove to cool.</p>

Season chicken all over with salt and pepper. <br> <strong>Step 2: </strong>In a large dutch oven over medium heat, add bacon and cook until crispy, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. <br><strong>Step 3:</strong>To same pot, add chicken, working in batches as necessary. Cook until skin is golden, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a plate. Drain all but 3 tablespoons oil from pot.<br> <strong>Step 4:</strong>To same pot, add mushrooms, onions, and carrots and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add tomato paste and stir to coat vegetables, then add flour and stir until vegetables are coated. Slowly pour in wine, broth, and brandy. Return chicken and half the bacon to pot. Add thyme, season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Whisk sugar, salt, and 1½ cups flour in a medium bowl to combine. Add butter and toss to combine. Using your hands and working quickly, rub and smash butter into flat, irregular pieces (be careful not to overwork; you don’t want to soften the butter too much).1 Drizzle ⅓ cup cold water over and mix with a rubber spatula, smashing in butter, until dough mostly comes together—it will be dry and shaggy. 
            <br> <strong>Step 2: </strong>Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Working quickly and using a rolling pin and your hands, press dough together to form a mass. Roll dough into a rough square about ½" thick. Fold in half into a rectangle, then once again to make a small square. Press down on the dough with rolling pin to make it hold together. Roll dough out once more to make a rough square about ½" thick. Repeat folding process, taking your time to make it neat as this will be your final fold. Using rolling pin, gently flatten dough, rotating as needed, to make a 6"-diameter disk. 
            <br><strong>Step 3:</strong>Dust surface with more flour and roll disk into a 14"-diameter circle or oval about ⅛" thick. Fold dough in half, then in half again to make a rough triangle (this will make it easier to move). Slide onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and unfold. Chill while you make the filling. 
            <br> <strong>Step 4:</strong>Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Wrap 6" disk tightly and chill until ready to roll out.</p>
